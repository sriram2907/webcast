## 💡 Development Approach

This project was built using a smart and efficient development workflow by leveraging **AI-assisted tools like Cursor (AI-enhanced VS Code)**.

Instead of spending excessive time on boilerplate and common setup tasks, I focused on:

* Architecting key features
* Exploring WebRTC and WebSocket technologies
* Rapid prototyping and UI design

> Using AI helped me work smarter, learn faster, and ship features quicker — without compromising code quality or learning depth.

## 📌 Roadmap / To-Do

* [ ] Webcam (face cam) sharing with WebRTC
* [ ] In-room live chat
* [ ] Room privacy settings (password-protected rooms)
* [ ] Video playback sync using custom player
* [ ] Mobile-first responsive layout
